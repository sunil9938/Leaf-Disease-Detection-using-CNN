Created a safety system that detects LPG gas leaks using MQ-6 gas sensors and automatically cuts off the gas supply to prevent accidents. The system includes an alarm that activates upon detecting leakage and ensures immediate action by shutting off the gas flow. This project involved circuit design, sensor integration, and microcontroller programming for real-time gas monitoring and automatic control.
