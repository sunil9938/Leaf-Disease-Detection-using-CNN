# Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

A deep learning-based project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and classify plant leaf diseases from images. This system helps farmers and researchers identify infections early, enabling better crop management and increased yield.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The model is trained on a plant disease dataset containing thousands of labeled leaf images. You can use:

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess leaf images (resize, normalize).
2. Train a CNN model to recognize disease patterns.
3. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall.
4. Use the trained model to predict diseases on new leaf images.
